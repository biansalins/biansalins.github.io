<h3>About Me</h3>
<div>
<p>If it's still appropriate to use the term 'digital native' then I guess I am one of them. My kids keep asking me, 'Mum are you a geek?' and I guess for anyone with 19 years of experience in all things tech - the answer has got to be 'yes'. 

I'm a journalist by background and content is second nature to me as is online/offline marketing communication. For anyone who loves technology, content and people - social is a breeze which is why I began to specialise in how social technology has and is transforming consumer behaviour. I've worked in social since 2008 and have helped drive some of the most successful teams and strategies for blue chip companies. I'm passionate about the success of women and diversity in the workplace and encouraging a culture of inclusion and acceptance within the places I work at.</p> 
<p>
Finally, if you're interested in my academics, I also have a first class degree in Economics and a postgraduate diploma in PR and Corporate Communications. I've trained in Excellence for Leadership, Project Management, Think Big â€“ Selling from the Left, user-centred design, and accessibility. Some of the technologies I've worked with in the past have been Interwoven, Obtree, Dreamweaver, Moveable Type, Wordpress and Vignette plus, Adobe Photoshop and more recently - Lithium, Salesforce Radian 6, Synthesio, Right Now platforms and Oracle.

That's me and my experience in a nutshell. Please feel free to get in touch if you think I can help you in any way. </p>
